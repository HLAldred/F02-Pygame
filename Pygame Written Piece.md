# FP4 - F02 - Pygame

# Reflection:
# How does Pygame use concepts like classes, methods, attributes, and encapsulation that surround OOP?
OOP is centered around creating objects and interacting with those objects. Pygame brings a visual to these objects, and helps give the user a better understanding of what is happening with their objects. Objects have features that allow for them to be interacted with in a variety of ways through attributes and methods. Pygame is a simple way to visualize objects and code, and to see them in action.

# Could this be done without OOP?
I feel like it probably could, but it would be quite difficult, as OOP keeps everything together, sorted, and concise, and I think using just normal coding would cause everything to be quite chaotic and messy. Along with that, OOP is designed to create full, usable object concepts, so it makes sense to use it for Pygame, rather than using individual code.
